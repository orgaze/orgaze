Orgaze is a program for studies or productivity. Made for people who doesn't want a lot of apps with ad's or premium plans for simple features. Personally speaking I made this program for myself (LuanderFarias). I made this cause i have ADHD. And organizing is something i'm not that great.

## Functions

As a "personal" project i did all the functions i think i would need to organize my personal life, startup's management and other things... But i actually want to receive people feedback of what types of functions they want. No program helped me with my ADHD so i want to make the program that help all the people with this condition or every people that need's help with organization.

#### Actual functions
- notes
- calendar
